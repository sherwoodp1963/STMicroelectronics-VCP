Aaran,

This is the latest version of the Virtual Com Ports drivers from STMicroelectronics. To download, it's easier if you have an account (free) because it will make the process go easier and quicker next time you need to update or initially install on a different computer.

STM32 Virtual COM Port Driver - STMicroelectronics website is:
> https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32102.html#get-software

When you press the download button, you will receive the compressed file...
> en.stsw-stm32102.zip

The file/application within the compressed file downloaded is:
> VCP_V1.5.0_Setup_W8_x64bits.exe

After installation, it makes references to Win7 and Win8. I haven't seen any references to Windows 10 or Windows 11 when it comes to the Virtual Com Ports.

Hope this helps.
